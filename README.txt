This application has been developed for research purposes.

Dependences:

PCL 1.7
VTK
QT4	--- QVTK is mandatory!!!


Building Instructions:

WRITE ME !!!
it compiles (I have tested) on MSVC2012 and ubuntu 14.04

the only problem which I noted is related to the qvtk package,
the QVTK package is required to run any pcl application with a qt visualizer. 
take a look here for further details:
